## Introduction

[Dan Buzzo's Tutorial on Sinewave Animation](https://youtu.be/kYejiSrzFzs?list=PL6QF0yo3Zj7DbN76C5-_6VCDF5CPBIz6l) explores a simple yet powerful way to visualize sine waves in OpenFrameworks. For my first assignment, I wanted to experiment with a variety of parameters that alter the shapes of the sketch. Instead of visualizing specific shapes, I tried to give some random tweaks to the code and see how everything unfolds. 

For this week's assignment, I wanted to expand my previous sketch [Yin-Yang Spirals] () by interpreting the idea of Yin-Yang in the context of digitality. As a well-known symbol of harmony in natural transformation, Yin-Yang visualizes the core principles of Taoism—one of the ancient Chinese philosophies. Taoists have used this symbol to describe how seemingly distant or opposite energies may be complementary, interconnected, and interdependent in the natural world. They view the universe as a complex blend of the cycles of Yin (receptive) and Yang (active), which can be seen in all forms of change and difference.

What particularly interests me is that we can also interpret this Yin-Yang as a “binary symbol” of the digital world, in which everything is composed of 0 and 1. In a sense, the digital world can be deemed a metaphor of Yin and Yang, as zero and one—nothingness (無) and thingness (有)—interrelate to one another and form into all different types of information and data. I intended to visualize this parallel between Taoism and the digital world-view, creating a series of visual metaphors of which 0 and 1 continuously embody and morph into natural dualities.
